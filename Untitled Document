Again DNS comes into play, but this time the look up is slightly different. The sending mail server will look up the MX record in DNS by following a sequence along these lines:

    Look up the authoritative name servers for microsoft.com
    Query the microsoft.com name servers for the MX records
    Look up the names of the MX records in DNS to get their IP addresses
